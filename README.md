# RGBPlug Type N
Compact DE-15 ("VGA") adapter for the SNES/SFC-style AV multi-out. Video timing is unchanged, so a monitor or video processor compatible with 15 kHz RGB is required. The switch toggles between separate H/V sync or composite sync output.

For the NTSC SNES/SFC or PAL GameCube, populate C6-C11 but do not populate R6-R8. For the PAL SNES, populate R6-R8 and bridge the pads of C6-C11.
